# Simple Server

## What Does It Do?

- I made this project for Makers Module 5 - Cloud Deployment - Phase 2.
- This is a simple web server that serves a single route.
- It is containerised with Docker
- It uses Exoframe to deploy to the cloud

## Why Is It Useful?

I used this project to:
- [x] Learn to containerise a web server using Docker.
- [x] Learn to explain how containerisation helps with deployment.
- [x] Learn to deploy a container to a toy cloud hosting system.

## How Do I Set It Up?

To set up this project:

```bash
; pipenv install
; pipenv shell
; pytest           # Run the tests
; python app.py    # Run the server
```
